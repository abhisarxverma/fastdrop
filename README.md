# Fastdrop [ In Development ]

Fastdrop is a lightweight web app for instant file sharing in classrooms and computer labs.  
Instead of relying on WhatsApp, email, or other login-heavy platforms, Fastdrop lets you **drop a file once and make it instantly visible to everyone nearby**.

## Concept
A frictionless, browser-based hub where any student or professor can share content files in real time without authentication barriers.

## Use Case
- Professors sharing code snippets, assignments, or resources during lab sessions.
- Students distributing project files or notes quickly to peers.
- Any group setting where fast, local file sharing is needed.

## Audience
- College students in labs and classrooms.
- Professors and teaching assistants.
- Teams working in shared computer environments.

## Problem It Solves
Traditional sharing methods (WhatsApp, email, cloud links) require logins, syncing, or copy-paste overhead.  
Fastdrop eliminates these steps, making **sharing as fast as opening a web page**.
